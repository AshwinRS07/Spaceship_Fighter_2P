# Spaceship_Fighter_2P
A simple project to understand basic game development behaviors using the PyGame library.
Current Implementation includes:
- Shared Screen 1v1 ship fighting.
- Static health bars.
- Collision for bullets with ships and each other.

Future/Ongoing Ideas:
- Boosts/Power-ups.
- Velocity instead of static controls.
- Zoning to discourage stalemates.
